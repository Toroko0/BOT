# The 'data' folder:
# If your 'data/' folder contains user-specific information that changes at runtime
# (like user scores, temporary files, or other dynamic content that shouldn't be versioned),

# If 'data/' contains static assets or configuration that are essential for the bot
# and should be part of the repository, then leave this line commented out.
